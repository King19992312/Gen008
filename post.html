                        <p>In a world where the concept of unity often feels like an elusive dream, there's one undeniable truth: we all share this magnificent planet, Earth. It's not just a piece of land we inhabit; it's a living, breathing entity that sustains all life. Yet, despite its importance, we continue to treat it with reckless abandon, especially when it comes to plastic waste.</p>
                        <p>Picture this: a plastic bag drifting lazily through the air, eventually finding its way into a river, then into the vast expanse of the ocean. Multiply that by millions, and you start to grasp the enormity of the plastic waste crisis. It's a problem that knows no borders, affecting every corner of our globe.</p>
                        <p>But here's the thing: we have the power to change course. Science has provided us with the knowledge and technology to tackle this issue head-on. From biodegradable alternatives to innovative recycling methods, there are solutions within our grasp. However, it requires a collective effort—a global mindset shift towards sustainability and environmental stewardship.</p>
                        <p>The iconic image of Earth from space, as described by astronauts like Frank Borman and Yuri Gagarin, has the power to awaken a sense of awe and reverence for our planet. It's a reminder of our interconnectedness, our shared responsibility to protect this fragile blue orb we call home.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Plastic-Waste-Free World</h2>
                        <p>As it stands, humanity now produces more than 200 million tonnes of plastic waste annually.  This is equal to around 523 trillion plastic straws which if laid lengthwise could wrap around the world approximately 2.8 million times. Close to half of this waste is mismanaged: openly burned, dumped directly or leaked into the environment and more than 11 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean every year
                            The report “Plastics: The cost to society, environment and the economy” reveals that across the lifecycle, plastic is responsible for generating 1.8 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) a year. That is more than the annual emissions from aviation and shipping combined. These GHG emissions are accelerating the surge of climate-change-related negative impacts such as shrinking glaciers, flooding, and crop death from more intense droughts, imposing huge costs on governments and society. Mismanaged plastic waste could threaten the ability of the oceans to act as a carbon sink, further contributing to the climate crisis. Plastic could therefore be contributing to the climate crisis on two fronts, by emitting carbon dioxide and by limiting the ability of the ocean to remove this carbon dioxide, exacerbating the impact of the emissions. </p>
                        <p>While the necessary global actions to tackle the plastic crisis are known, current initiatives lack the necessary scale to drive systemic change and to address this crisis on a systemic level and reduce the cost that plastic imposes on society more effectively, WWF calls the governments to start the negotiation of a legally binding global treaty on marine plastic pollution at the 5th session of the UN Environment Assembly in February 2022. A global treaty must tackle all stages of the plastic lifecycle, stopping the leakage of plastic pollution into the oceans by 2030. As we wait for that, how about we stop using single-use plastics and make our planet a healthier place.</p>
